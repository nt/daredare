## Where is Dare Dare ?

### Pacific Cup tracker

The best way to track our position and that of our competition during the race
is on the race tracker. The link has not been published yet but should be
available here: [https://pacificcup.org/tracklinks.html](https://pacificcup.org/tracklinks.html)

### Dare Dare Garmin tracker

This tracker is a backup device we will be using during the race. We will
configure it to update our location every 4 hours. This method might fail if we
forget to charge the battery for the tracker so do not worry if it does not
update!
