## 2018 Pacific Cup

We are racing in the 2018 Pacific Cup. All information regarding the race can be
found on the race's website: [https://pacificcup.org/](https://pacificcup.org/).

### Communication and news

While offshore, access to internet is very limited. We use [Iridium Go](https://www.iridium.com/products/iridium-go/)
to check in with the race committee and download wheather files. We will not be
able to check our personal email but only a race committee dedicated address.
We will do our best to email and update the email group ([dare-dare-pac-cup-2018](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dare-dare-pac-cup-2018))
every other day but we will not be able to receive your messages.

This website also has an [Updates](/updates) section that we should be able to
update offshore.

In case of an emergency you can contact the [Pac Cup race committee](https://pacificcup.org/contact-us)
and they will be able to get in touch with us.

At sea equipement failure might prevent us from updating the email group or the
tracker and this is perfectly normal. Absence of communication simply means we
might have lost our ability to communicate. The most recent and frequent updates
can be found on the Pacific Cup website.
